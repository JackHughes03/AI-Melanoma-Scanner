# AI model to detect melanoma skin cancer

## Dataset used
<ul>
  <li>This model was built using the dataset <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasnainjaved/melanoma-skin-cancer-dataset-of-10000-images">Melanoma Skin Cancer Dataset of 10000 Images.</a></li>
  <li>It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of skin lesions as either benign or malignant.</li>
</ul>

## How to use
<ul>
  <li>Checkout the latest release and download the zip</li>
  <li>Unzip the zip then unzip dataset.zip and model.zip</li>
  <li>Run main.exe</li>
  <li>Upload a clear picture you want to test and get your result</li>
</ul>

## Training model option
<p>There should not be a need to re-train the model as there is already a trained model in the directory. It is also not recommended to train the model again because it takes so long. But if you have to, just click the 're-train model' button and wait until it is done.</p>

## Utilising this model in medical technology
<p>Whilst this model is not currently fit for accurate predictions in the real-world, it still presents a high accuracy rate. This model with some adapting, is an example of what can be achieved with artifical intelligence to help patients get an answer quicker.</p>
